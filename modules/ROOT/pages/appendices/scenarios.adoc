This appendix chapter specifies the usage scenarios of beep through a table of user stories, and an UML "Use Case" diagram. These usage scenarios MUST be provided by Beep.

In the below table, the following subjects are identified:

- Guest: a user who does not have an account on Beep, or a logged-out user.
- User: a user who has an account on Beep, and is logged-in.
- Friend: a user who is a friend of another user on Beep, and can communiate with them privately.

The below UML "Use Case" diagram specifies the use cases of Beep as well, with the end user's different roles as actors, and the user stories as use cases.

//I believe this diagram is unreadable. Rotate it (can't in asciidoc it seems), zoom in or cut it in parts, or remove its margins, or provide interactive zoom controls, or provide a static always-available link to an explorable version of this diagram.

The purpose of this schema is to capture the requirements of Beep considering its users. This will help us outline business capabilities and user stories into functional neighborhoods, and thus redefine Beep into microservices.
//TODO: stop the blabla between business capabilities and user stories. Time to be clear and concise, bro. Yeah.

A business capability is the expression or articulation of the capacity, materials, and expertise an organization needs to perform core functions.

Modify to add a "friend" user and the added/modified use cases.
Also make it vertical.
