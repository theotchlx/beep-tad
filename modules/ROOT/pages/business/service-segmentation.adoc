= Service segmentation

This chapter defines the xref:glossary.adoc#definitions-of-terms[_business services_] of Beep.

Services are segmented in domains. Business capabilities are separated. Core logic is segregated.

== Layout

The following table defines the segmentation of Beep's usage scenarios into services.


[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Service name |Goal and provided features

|Authentication
|Authenticate users and other external requests, manage xref:glossary.adoc#definitions-of-terms[_core user identity_].

|User
|Manage xref:glossary.adoc#definitions-of-terms[_Beep-specific user identity_].

|Chat
|Manage text channel conversations.

|Call
|Enable users to share voice/video feeds with minimal latency in voice channels.

|Search
|Provide results to search queries for servers, channels, users, messages and files.

|Notification
|Manage push notifications sent to devices.

|Files
|Manage file storage and retrieval.

|Frontend
|Provide a web interface to users to arrange the lifecycle of usage scenarios on the web application.

Missing the authorization serivce, missing the fast that authn is keycloak, see others that could be missing.

UML "Component" diagram


These functional neighborhoods/business capabilities/... can be formally represented using a UML component diagram. Below is the resulting UML component diagram describing my proposal for Beep's separation into microservices.

//TODO: refaire un second diagramme de composants avec des blocs au lieu des services et dedans deux composants : l'applicatif et la bdd associée. Peut être les sidecars aussi?? nan...?

The idea is that you can easily reuse and/or substitute a different component implementation in your designs because **a component encapsulates behavior and implements specified interfaces**.
