= Physical infrastructure

This chapter specifies the expected fundamental hardware setup.

== Hardware and physical network configuration

=== Physical constraints

Hardware infrastructure MAY run on infrastructure provided by Polytech Montpellier

Hardware infrastructure MAY be contained within Polytech Montpellier's network. This means all traffic network must pass through Polytech's gateway servers.

== Infrastructure security

=== Data confidentiality

Persistent data stored on hard drives MAY be encrypted using secure algorithms.

=== Data integrity

Hard drives SHOULD be configured in a software RAID1 array.

Disk backups MUST be setup to run bi-weekly.

=== Data availability
