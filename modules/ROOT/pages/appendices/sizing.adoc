= APPENDIX II: System sizing requirements
:navtitle: System sizing

This appendix chapter specifies the system sizing requirements as estimates of average loads and limitations. These estimates are operational targets that MUST be met for Beep to be considered fully operational.

== Estimates of averages

The below table specifies the system sizing requirements estimates of averages.

=== Fundamental sizing metrics

The below table specifies the system sizing requirements estimates of averages.
