= Software infrastructure

This chapter defines the software infrastructure layout of the system. The rest of Beep's software system is deployed on top of this software infrastructure.

Software deployment infrastructure?

== Layout

UML Component diagram? Or some other diagram to show the software infrastructure components and their relationships, the software infrastructure architecture.

- Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) cluster MAY

- Kubernetes (K8s) cluster MUST
- Ceph cluster

Smartmontools on top of PVE to monitor the disks and predict disk failure on top of ceph, send alerts... SHOULD

K8s on proxmox

Kube on proxmox

== System upgrades

The system MUST be able to be upgraded without downtime.
This means that the system MUST be able to be upgraded without stopping the system or any of its components.
This is a requirement for all components of the system, including the operating system, the software infrastructure, and the applications running on top of it.

== Security requirements

=== Operating systems

Every operating system running in the system MUST be either:

- The latest actively maintained LTS GNU/Linux version, including derivative distributions,
- The latest actively maintained OpenBSD version, including derivate distributions.

=== Dependencies

Graphical components such as windowing systems, desktop environments, and graphical applications SHOULD NOT be installed on the system.

=== Data confidentiality

All sensitive information MUST be encrypted using any secure encryption algorithm.
//TODO: préciser les contraintes sur ces algos (institut qui les vérifie, assure leur non-breach state, etc) Aussi peut être en proposer, en mode "such as AES" etc?

Sensitive informations includes:

- User information (e.g. name, address, email, password, contact information and other user-related informations)

=== Data integrity

Hard drives SHOULD be configured in a software RAID1 array.

Disk backups MUST be setup to run bi-weekly.

=== Data availability
