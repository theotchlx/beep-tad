= Physical infrastructure

This chapter specifies the expected fundamental hardware setup.

== Hardware and physical network configuration

=== Physical constraints

Hardware infrastructure SHOULD run on infrastructure provided by Polytech Montpellier

Hardware infrastructure SHOULD be contained within Polytech Montpellier's network. If so, this means all network traffic MUST pass through Polytech's gateway servers.

== Infrastructure security

=== Data confidentiality

Persistent data stored on hard drives MAY be encrypted using the LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) disk encryption specification.

=== Data integrity

Hard drives SHOULD be configured in a software RAID1 array.

Disk backups MUST be setup to run bi-weekly.

=== Data availability
